Groovy greets you with your list of budgets presented in a wonderful card layout.
You can add a budget by clicking the ( + ) button. You can also swipe on each card to get shortcuts to "Edit", "Share", and "Delete".

Tapping on a budget will present you with your budget's status. The haptic feedback and animated circle offer a sense of control and mindfulness. From here you can add a purchase by tapping the ( + ), or tap the ( . . . ) to get options to view the "History", "Edit", or "Delete" views. Tap the user icon at the top to visit the share view which manages users that can use this budget.

## Frameworks

*  [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit)
*  [Dispatch](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/DISPATCH)

  

## Libraries

Groovy uses built-in Swift libraries for networking:

*  [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession)
*  [JSONSerialization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsonserialization)


## CocoaPods

Groovy ‚ù§Ô∏è's the amazing iOS community.

* [Firebase](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Firebase)
* [Spring](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Spring)
* [Pastel](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Pastel)
* [DeviceKit](https://cocoapods.org/pods/DeviceKit)
* [UICircularProgressRing](https://cocoapods.org/pods/UICircularProgressRing)
  
## Network
* Groovy uses the [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) to store data locally and in the cloud.  Firebase uses web sockets to make sure everything is in sync in realtime. When you or a friend make a change to a shared budget, everyone will see the updates instantly. It's pretty amazing.

* Groovy uses the [Quotes REST API](https://quotes.rest) to get a daily inspirational quote to make sure you're staying motivated.
